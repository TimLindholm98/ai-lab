The "power process" described by Ted consists of four interdependent elements: authority, influence, control, and legitimacy.

1. **Authority**: This is the foundational element that grants the right to make decisions and give orders, providing a basis for exerting power.

2. **Influence**: It involves persuading others or shaping opinions, which complements authority by helping to maintain control beyond mere commands through factors like expertise or charm.

3. **Control**: This element ensures management over resources, information, and access, essential for maintaining the position of power and enforcing decisions effectively.

4. **Legitimacy**: Acceptance by others that the power is justified, often derived from social norms, laws, or established roles, ensuring that authority is effective as people recognize its basis.

Together, these elements form a process that not only establishes but also sustains and reinforces power over time.
